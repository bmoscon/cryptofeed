## Contributing Guidelines

PRs, bug reports, feature requests, documentation, and other enhancements and improvements are welcomed. Please have a look at this checklist before contributing

### For Issues

* Is this a question? Questions are permitted, but a better way to get support for questions is to join the slack channel and ask there (Link in README), or open a thread in the repository's Discussions tab.
* Is this something that is extremely specific to your use case, or will it likely be useful and beneficial to other users of the library? 
* Do you have an idea for what you are requesting? If so, please include that! Details are helpful.
* For bug reports please include a way to reproduce the issue - issues that cannot be reproduced cannot be fixed and will be closed.
* For new exchange requests please include links to the API documentation.


### For PRs

* Has it been tested? How?
* Does the code style match the overall code style of the project? Long lines are preferred, so please do not use formatters that turn 1 line into 4 lines.
* Please use type annotations.
* Please run flake8 and fix any formatting issues it uncovers.
