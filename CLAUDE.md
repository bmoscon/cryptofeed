## Core Engineering Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Prefer well-scoped conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.) to keep history searchable
- Document behavioral changes in the subject; leave refactors/docs/tests as chore/test/docs prefixes
- Avoid multi-purpose commits—split when scope spans unrelated areas
- Tie commits to spec/task IDs when available for traceability

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid premature optimization
- Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- Minimize cognitive load for future developers

### Conventional Commits
- Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc., to label intent and surface change type quickly
- Keep commit scope tight—one functional concern per commit, split unrelated work
- Reference spec/task IDs when available to maintain traceability
- Describe the user-facing behavior change in the subject; reserve details for the body if needed

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common functionality into reusable components
- Use configuration over duplication
- Share metadata/transport logic across derived feeds
- Avoid duplicated rate limit logic

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Implement only what's needed now
- Defer features until they're actually required
- Keep configuration surface minimal
- Avoid building for hypothetical future requirements

### FRs Over NFRs
- Deliver functional requirements before tuning non-functional concerns
- Capture NFR gaps as follow-up work instead of blocking feature delivery
- Align prioritization with user impact, revisiting NFRs once core behavior ships
- Treat performance, resiliency, and compliance targets as iterative enhancements unless explicitly critical

## Development Standards

### NO MOCKS
- Use real implementations with test fixtures
- Prefer integration tests over heavily mocked unit tests
- Test against actual exchange APIs when possible
- Use ccxt sandbox or permissive endpoints for testing

### NO LEGACY
- Remove deprecated code aggressively
- Don't maintain backward compatibility for internal APIs
- Upgrade dependencies regularly
- Clean architecture without legacy workarounds

### NO COMPATIBILITY
- Target latest Python versions
- Use modern language features
- Don't support outdated exchange API versions
- Break APIs when it improves design

### START SMALL
- Begin with MVP implementations
- Support minimal viable feature set first
- Add complexity only when justified
- Iterative development over big bang releases

### CONSISTENT NAMING WITHOUT PREFIXES
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid Hungarian notation or type prefixes
- Consistent verb tenses (get/set, fetch/push)
- Domain-specific terminology over generic names

## Agentic Coding Best Practices

### Research-Plan-Execute Workflow
1. **Research Phase**: Read relevant files, understand context
2. **Planning Phase**: Outline solution architecture
3. **Execution Phase**: Implement with continuous verification
4. **Validation Phase**: Test and verify implementation

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests first based on expected behavior
- Run tests to confirm they fail
- Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor without changing test behavior
- Never modify tests to fit implementation

### Context Engineering
- Maintain project context in CLAUDE.md
- Use specific, actionable instructions
- Provide file paths and screenshots for UI work
- Reference existing patterns and conventions
- Clear context between major tasks

### Iterative Development
- Make small, verifiable changes
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use subagents for complex verification tasks
- Review code changes continuously
- Maintain clean git history

## Context Engineering Principles

### Information Architecture
- **Prioritize by Relevance**: Most important information first
- **Logical Categorization**: Group related context together
- **Progressive Detail**: Start essential, add layers gradually
- **Clear Relationships**: Show dependencies and connections

### Dynamic Context Systems
- **Runtime Context**: Generate context on-demand for tasks
- **State Management**: Track conversation and project state
- **Memory Integration**: Combine short-term and long-term knowledge
- **Tool Integration**: Provide relevant tool and API context

### Context Optimization
- **Precision Over Volume**: Quality information over quantity
- **Format Consistency**: Structured, scannable information
- **Relevance Filtering**: Include only task-relevant context
- **Context Window Management**: Efficient use of available space

## Cryptofeed-Specific Guidelines

### Exchange Integration
- Use ccxt for standardized exchange APIs
- Follow existing emitter/queue patterns
- Implement proper rate limiting and backoff
- Handle regional restrictions with proxy support

### Data Normalization
- Convert timestamps to consistent float seconds
- Use Decimal for price/quantity precision
- Preserve sequence numbers for gap detection
- Normalize symbols via ccxt helpers

### Error Handling
- Surface HTTP errors with actionable messages
- Provide fallback modes (REST-only, alternative endpoints)
- Log warnings for experimental features
- Implement graceful degradation

### Configuration
- Use YAML configuration files
- Support environment variable interpolation
- Provide clear examples and documentation
- Allow per-deployment customization

### Architecture Patterns
```
CcxtGenericFeed
 ├─ CcxtMetadataCache   → ccxt.exchange.load_markets()
 ├─ CcxtRestTransport   → ccxt.async_support.exchange.fetch_*()
 └─ CcxtWsTransport     → ccxt.pro.exchange.watch_*()
      ↳ CcxtEmitter     → existing BackendQueue/Metrics
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Mock ccxt transports for isolated testing
- Test symbol normalization and data transformation
- Verify queue integration and error handling
- Assert configuration parsing and validation

### Integration Testing
- Test against live exchange APIs (sandbox when available)
- Verify trade/L2 callback sequences
- Test with actual proxy configurations
- Record sample payloads for regression testing

### Regression Testing
- Maintain docker-compose test harnesses
- Test across ccxt version updates
- Verify backward compatibility of configurations
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
