# GitHub Workflows Post-Approval Monitoring Plan

## 🎯 **Immediate Monitoring Strategy**

### **Phase 1: First 2 Minutes (Critical Window)**
Monitor for immediate configuration failures:

```bash
# Commands to run after approval
gh run list --branch feature/setup-trunk --limit 5
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

**Success Indicators**:
- [ ] All 5 workflows start executing simultaneously
- [ ] No immediate YAML syntax errors
- [ ] Job initialization completes successfully

**Failure Indicators**:
- 🚨 Workflow fails to start (YAML syntax error)
- 🚨 Permission denied errors
- 🚨 Missing secrets errors

### **Phase 2: 2-5 Minutes (Setup Phase)**
Monitor dependency installation and environment setup:

**Key Log Sections to Watch**:
```bash
# In CI/CD Pipeline
✅ "Set up Python" - should complete in ~30s
✅ "Install uv" - should complete in ~45s  
✅ "Install and setup Trunk" - should complete in ~90s
✅ "Install dependencies with uv" - should complete in ~120s

# In all other workflows
✅ Similar dependency setup patterns
✅ No "command not found" errors
✅ Virtual environment creation success
```

**Red Flags**:
- 🚨 uv installation timeout
- 🚨 Trunk setup failures
- 🚨 Python dependency conflicts
- 🚨 Virtual environment creation errors

### **Phase 3: 5-15 Minutes (Execution Phase)**
Monitor core workflow execution:

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
```bash
# Critical steps to monitor
✅ "Run linting with Trunk (preferred)" 
✅ "Run tests with pytest"
✅ "Check integration tests"
✅ "Build package"
```

**Code Quality Analysis**:
```bash
# Quality analysis steps
✅ "Run comprehensive quality analysis with Trunk"
✅ "Generate quality metrics"
✅ "Check code smells"
✅ "Check docstring coverage"
```

**Security Scanning**:
```bash
# Security analysis steps  
✅ "Run CodeQL Analysis"
✅ "Run vulnerability scanning"
✅ "Run secrets detection"
✅ "Check license compliance"
```

**Performance Benchmarks**:
```bash
# Performance testing steps
✅ "System information collection"
✅ "Basic performance benchmarks" 
✅ "Memory profiling" (may timeout - acceptable)
✅ "Network latency tests"
```

## 🚨 **Failure Response Procedures**

### **Immediate Failures (0-2 minutes)**
If workflows fail to start:

1. **Check YAML Syntax**:
```bash
# Validate locally
trunk check --filter=yamllint .github/workflows/
trunk check --filter=actionlint .github/workflows/
```

2. **Check Permissions**:
```bash
# Verify in workflow file
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  security-events: write
```

3. **Emergency Fix Process**:
```bash
# If critical syntax error found
git checkout -b hotfix/workflow-syntax
# Fix the issue
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve workflow syntax error"
git push origin hotfix/workflow-syntax
```

### **Setup Failures (2-5 minutes)**
If dependency installation fails:

1. **Trunk Setup Failure**:
```yaml
# Fallback already implemented - verify it runs:
- name: Install tools fallback
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "🚨 Trunk failed, using manual installation..."
    uv add --dev ruff mypy bandit
```

2. **uv Installation Failure**:
```yaml
# Fallback to pip (already implemented):
- name: Fallback to pip
  if: failure()
  run: |
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .[dev]
```

3. **Dependency Conflicts**:
```bash
# Check logs for specific conflicts
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -i "error\|conflict\|failed"
```

### **Execution Failures (5-30 minutes)**
If workflow steps fail during execution:

1. **Test Failures** (Expected and Acceptable):
```bash
# These failures are informational, not blocking
❌ Test suite failures (shows real code issues)
❌ Linting violations (shows code quality issues)  
❌ Security vulnerabilities (shows security issues)
```

2. **Infrastructure Failures** (Need Investigation):
```bash
# These need attention
🚨 Timeout errors (resource constraints)
🚨 Memory errors (need to optimize)
🚨 Network errors (GitHub infrastructure)
🚨 API rate limiting (need backoff strategy)
```

## 📊 **Success Metrics to Track**

### **Critical Success Indicators**
- [ ] **Workflow Completion Rate**: >80% of workflows complete
- [ ] **Average Runtime**: <30 minutes total
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Fallback mechanisms activate when needed
- [ ] **Artifact Generation**: All expected artifacts created

### **Quality Indicators**
- [ ] **Code Coverage**: Reports generated successfully
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: SARIF files uploaded to GitHub Security
- [ ] **Performance Data**: Benchmark results available
- [ ] **Documentation**: All quality metrics calculated

### **Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Check overall status
gh run list --branch feature/setup-trunk --limit 5

# Monitor specific workflow
gh run view <run-id>

# Get failure details
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Check artifacts
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -i "artifact"

# Monitor PR checks
gh pr checks 1086
```

## 🔄 **Continuous Monitoring (First 24 Hours)**

### **Hour 1-2: Active Monitoring**
- Monitor all workflow executions in real-time
- Respond immediately to any failures
- Document any unexpected issues

### **Hour 2-6: Periodic Checks**
- Check every 30 minutes for completion status
- Monitor artifact uploads and PR comments
- Verify security scans upload to GitHub Security tab

### **Hour 6-24: Passive Monitoring**  
- Check once every 2-3 hours
- Monitor for any delayed failures or retries
- Verify no resource exhaustion issues
