## Book Validation Mechanisms

Some exchanges support methods for ensuring orderbooks are correct. The two most prevalent methods are sequence numbers and orderbook checksums. With sequence numbers, you can detect a missing message and reset the book/connection. With checksums you must manually calculate a checksum on the orderbook (or some subset of  the book) and compare that to the exchange provided checksum. Sequence number checking takes a negligible amount of time, whereas checksum validation can take a noticeable amount of time (0.4 to 0.8 ms). Sequence number validation is enabled on all supporting exchanges. Checksum validation must be enabled by the end user (set the `checksum_validation` kwarg to `True`). Other exchanges do not supply orderbook deltas (snapshots only), so a missing message will not result in an incorrect orderbook. This list indicates what exchanges support what features.

<br/>
<sup>1</sup> Coinbase sequence number validation only works when L3 books are enabled for a symbol
<br/>
<br/>

For even more assurances that books are in the expected state (or for use in debugging), you can enabled a cross check on book updates as well with the `cross_check` kwarg set to `True`.  

If an exchange does not provide snapshots only, sequence numbers, or checksums, there is no guarantee that all messages have been received or that an orderbook is in the correct state.
