## Book Validation Mechanisms

Some exchanges support methods for ensuring orderbooks are correct. The two most prevalent methods are sequence numbers and orderbook checksums. With sequence numbers, you can detect a missing message and reset the book/connection. With checksums you must manually calculate a checksum on the orderbook (or some subset of the book) and compare that to the exchange provided checksum. Sequence number checking takes a negligible amount of time, whereas checksum validation can take a noticeable amount of time (depending on the exchange and the configured book depth, it ranges from roughly 10 to 100 microseconds per update). Sequence number validation is enabled on all supporting exchanges. Checksum validation must be enabled by the end user (set the `checksum_validation` kwarg to `True`). Other exchanges do not supply orderbook deltas (snapshots only), so a missing message will not result in an incorrect orderbook. This list indicates what exchanges support what features.

<sup>1</sup> Coinbase sequence number validation only works when L3 books are enabled for a symbol
<br/>
<br/>
<sup>2</sup> dYdX uses offsets that monotonically increase to help ensure updates are applied in order. They are not quite the same as sequence numbers, strictly speaking. You should enable `cross_check=True` on the dYdX exchange object to avoid crossed books.
<br/>
<br/>

For even more assurance that an orderbook is in the expected state (or for use in debugging), you can enable a cross check on book updates with the `cross_check` kwarg set to `True`.  

If an exchange does not provide snapshots only, sequence numbers, or checksums, there is no guarantee that all messages have been received or that an orderbook is in the correct state.
