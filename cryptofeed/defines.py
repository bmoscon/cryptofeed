Delta is in format of:

for L2 books, it is as below
for L3 books:
    * DEL will be an array of order-id, price tuples
    * UPD will include order-id in each tuple

    {
        BID: {
            DEL: [price, price, price, ...]
            UPD: [(price, size), (price, size), ...]
        },
        ASK: {
            DEL: [price, price, price, ...]
            UPD: [(price, size), (price, size), ...]
        }
    }

    DEL - price levels should be deleted (for L3 the order id should be deleted, if the price level is now empty, delete the price level)
    UPD - prices should have the quantity set to size (these are not price deltas). For L3, add the order id at the price level
